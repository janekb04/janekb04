I am a student at the [Warsaw Staszic High School](https://staszic.waw.pl/). My main areas of interest are physics and computer science. I am especially into advanced C++ programming and physically based real-time rendering. You can find some of my projects on [Github](https://github.com/janekb04). I also host an educational [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0mx7h3jJtmfwNB4oL2qr6A), where I share my knowledge with the world.

I also take part in [Cyberduck](https://cyberduckproject.github.io/) – a robotics project whose goal is to create a portable aqueous meteorological station in the shape of a mallard. Additionally, I also participate in [PaSh](https://github.com/binpash/pash) – a shell-script parallelisation project hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/linux-foundation-to-host-the-pash-project-accelerating-shell-scripting-with-automated-parallelization-for-industrial-use-cases/).

In free time, I like doing renders in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) – an open-source 3D graphics suite. You can find my works [on my website](https://janbielak.com/). You can also find there a showcase of renderers of my own making.
