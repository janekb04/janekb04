Hi, my name is Jan Bielak and I am a high school student. I like programming (especially in C++) and real-time rendering (including using OpenGL and Vulkan). Here you can find some of my projects. I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0mx7h3jJtmfwNB4oL2qr6A) related to programming and graphics where I post recordings of meetings of The C++ Club. It is a club about modern C++ I conduct at my school.
